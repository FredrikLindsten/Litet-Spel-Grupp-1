To parse these levels we need to build them via explicit measures.

Level building consists of importing the .mb-files necessary ONCE and then duplicating them from the already imported objects,
as that should keep the names consistent. There will be a default "level" scene for use in Maya, with items included.
Work from this and save the file as any name you wish as long as the title contains the word "level".

All individual node settings are typeset in the nodename (ie: bools, references, flags).

Naming convention:
	Base naming:
		p
		Render object ID
		GameObject name
		activation ID
		
		example: p_00_Door1
		Where render object name is pDoor, activation ID is 1.
	
	Additional naming (added to base name):
	[Additional naming is separated by underscores as so "_"]
	
		Doors:
		[must have 'door' in the title]
			open/closed
			start/end/other
			
			full example: p_00_Door1_closed_end
			
		Lever:
		[must have 'lever' in the title]
			poweron/poweroff
			up/down                      - up: unactivated, down: activated
			
			activates object reference   - the name of the component you wish to activate
			
			full example: p_01_Lever1_poweron_up_00Door1
			
		Pressure plates:
		[must have 'pressure' in the title]
			activates object reference   - the name of the component you wish to activate
			
			full example: p_02_Pressure1_01Lever1
			
		Shadow container:
		[must have 'container' in the title]
			activates object reference   - the name of the component you wish to activate
			
			full example: p_03_Container1_01Lever1

***If the object is not referring to any other component,
***or if an additional naming part is missing, add "_NULL"
